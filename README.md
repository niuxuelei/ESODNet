# ESODNet
[JAG 2025] Code for "ESODNet: A Real-Time Small Object Detection Framework for Remote Sensing Images with Cross-Scale Feature Fusion and Adaptive Diffusion"
# 📦 ESODNet

## 📖 Introduction

The bird’s-eye view provided by remote sensing imagery (RSI), as illustrated in Fig. 1, present several challenges:  
(a) varying object scales, (b) complex and cluttered backgrounds,  
(c) dense spatial distributions, and (d) the combined effect of scale variation and dense distributions,  
all of which complicate the accurate classification and regression of objects.

## 🎨 Overview

Overall architecture of ESODNet with a lightweight backbone, the CSAD neck, and the LTFA Head that jointly support real-time multi-scale object prediction.
